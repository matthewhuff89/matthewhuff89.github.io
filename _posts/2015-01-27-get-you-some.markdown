Hellloooooooo internet. This is my professional site. I'm going to be using this space to write about my experiences and what I'm learning as I grow as a developer.

I'm thinking first up on my learning plate is going to be CSS and Responsive Design...I'll let ya'll know.


So sit down, relax, have a cup of tea (or whatever it is that you like), and enjoy!

{% highlight ruby %}
def get_you_some(name)
  puts "Get you some, #{name}!!"
end
get_you_some('Murok')
#=> prints 'Get you some, Murok!!' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

The above was me playing with Jekyll's highlighter feature. I'm not gonna remove it. Deal with it.
