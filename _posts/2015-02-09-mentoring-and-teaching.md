Hello internet.

For the last 2 weeks, I've been working as a coach at Dev Bootcamp and I've just recently started teaching a friend of a friend JavaScript and some basic programming concepts. It's been a goddamn enlightening experience.

Teaching is hard as hell O_O...

If I didn't actually care about being of service to the people I coach and teach, it wouldn't be a problem. I'd just say whatever sounded good and just be on with my day...but I know better.

I've had bad teachers, and I've had fucking amazing teachers. I refuse to be the former. I have no qualms with exposing my own ignorance if it means I can avoid leading those I try to educate down a rabbit hole.

To be honest...it's so god damn awesome to see someone you're coaching overcome a problem. I was actually a little teary over it (in private, where no one could see me) about it. I could totally see why someone would do it for a living. Do I want to do it for a living? No. I want to get paid. I'll save the teaching life for when I'm older and have a better idea of how the world works.

This is so fucked up that I'm even writing about stuff like this. When the hell did I become this person?
