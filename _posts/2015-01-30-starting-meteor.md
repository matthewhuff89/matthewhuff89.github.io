So I've decided on my next couple of projects.

1. Me and my teammate Dmitri are going to look at making a new game.

2. Me personally? I'm going to be working on learning everything I can about the Javascript-based framework [Meteor][meteor]. Once I've got a good foundation, I'm going to rebuild a Sinatra app I made to help me with my dream journaling...using Meteor this time. I figure this will be a great way for me to learn a whole bunch of new technologies and work on my JavaScript at the same time!

Those two projects alone will definitely keep me busy for the next few months while I do coaching at DBC and come up with ways to get paid.

Let's do this.
