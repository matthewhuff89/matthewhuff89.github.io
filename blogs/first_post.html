  <p>It's strange.</p>
  <p>I've realized today, that pretty much everything in my life that I've ever considered a problem, usually arose through a lack of awareness.</p>
  <p>For instance, fucking my money up. Spending more than I could. Not saving enough and then getting hit with an emergency...if I had simply paid attention to my spending, to my saving, it would have never become a problem.</p>
  <p>How often does something you're actively paying attention to become a problem in your life?</p>
  <p>I find it to be a rare occurence honestly.</p>
  <p>I mean, sure. Maybe in video games, like a match of Street Fighter, and someone just turns up the heat and whoops your ass...but even then. That just suggests a lack of awareness about techniques, positioning, and so many more than things that you can improve on.</p>
  <p>It's oddly comforting.</p>"
  <p>It's making it harder for me to think of things as "mistakes" now.</p>
  <p>I just see opportunities to be more aware now.</p>
