<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
What's up?? My name is Matthew D. Huff AKA Lord Murok AKA The Phantom Sorcerer AKA The Evil Executive AKA Matt The Infinite. You may call me whichever you prefer.
</p>
<p>
I was born and raised in Birmingham, AL. I went to college at the University of Alabama. I'm really into futurism, Raja Yoga, Buddhism, video games, comics, manga, movies, beef, martial arts, and most recently web and software development! I have finally come full circle and realized my destiny as a nerd</p>
<p>
  Last thing: I'm an Aquarius. Holla at me.
