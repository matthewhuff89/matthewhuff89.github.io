      <h4>What is pair programming?</h4>
      <p id="words">
        Pair programming is when two people pair up to get some programming done! Generally it is done (at least at DBC) with a driver and a navigator. The navigator lays out the plan and directs the driver who does all the programming and determines what code would best fulfill the navigator's needs.

      <h4>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</h4>
      <p id="words">Pair programming is important because it teaches us how to work with others to make badass code, while at the same time learning how to direct and be directed by others.</p>

        <p id="words">The driver is the one who writes the code. The navigator directs the driver and keeps his/her eye on the big picture, the goal to be accomplished with the program.</p>

        <h4>Reflection!</h4>
        <p id="words">This was my first time pairing, and it was awesome! I really enjoyed it. I felt like it worked very well because my pair was an awesome driver, and made me feel good about my navigation. I can't honestly even say that I felt like nothing worked!</p>
