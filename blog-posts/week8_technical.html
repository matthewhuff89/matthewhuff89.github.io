<!--Introduction to Topic-->
<section>
<p>Let's jump right in. Ruby on Rails (or just Rails), is a web application framework which uses Ruby as it's language. I'm going to break down all of that for yours and my sake. I'm gonna define 1. What is a web application?, 2. What is a framework?, and 3. What EXACTLY is Rails and why should I care? LETS DO IT.</p>
</section>

<!--First Paragraph-->
<section>
  <h4>What is a web application?</h4>
  <p>You know those applications and programs you use all the time? Like Microsoft Word before there was such thing as Google Docs? No? Um, well, how about videogames? That's what you would call software. Programs that are executed using computers. Another word for those programs? Applications! So take a guess, what's a WEB application then?</p>
  <p>I'm going to assume you guessed correctly, because you're awesome.</p>
  <p>A web application is ANY piece of software that runs inside of a web browser, like Google Chrome or Firefox or Safari. Some notable examples would be Google Docs, Facebook, Twitter...I could go on. Web applications are huge nowadays, and do all sorts of stuff.  One of my personal favorites is the Mint.com web app!</p>
  <p>Ok let's move on.</p>
</section>

<!--Second Paragraph-->
<section>
  <h4>What is a framework?</h4>
  <p>In this case, we're talking about web application frameworks, and what those do: to make a long story short? They make it way easier to develop web applications. Hmm...what's a good metaphor to describe a framework....OH, I GOT ONE.</p>
  <p>Let's say you make hamburgers. And someone comes up with a framework for making those delicious burgers. All you have to do, is get and cook the meat, the framework will handle the organization of the bun and toppings.</p>
  <p>Well, maybe not the best way to describe a complex system. But I'm trying damn it!</p>
  <p>The cool thing about frameworks is they have tools to help pull together everything you need to make a web application. From integrating HTML/CSS/JavaScript code, and creating simple ways to interface with your app's databases and SQL.</p>
</section>

<!--Third Paragraph-->
<section>
  <h4>What is Rails? Why Should I Care?</h4>
  <p>Rails is one of the hottest ways to make a web application right now in the world of developers. It's a web application framework that uses the model-view-controller pattern AKA MVC. I'm going to break that down real fast: It's a pattern that divides application activities into 3 parts.<p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Model: Manages the data, logic, and rules of the application</li>
    <li>The View: Basically, the output of the application, what a user sees based on information it's been given (think about View options on Sublime or Document applications, do you want landscape view? Sort of like that..)</li>
    <li>The Controller: The part that accepts input, and allows you to affect and manipulate the Model. Basically, think COMMANDING/CONTROLLING the MODEL to change your VIEW to a 2 column view on your Word Editor</li>
  </ul>
<p>Ok, back to Rails! It was developed by a dude named David Heinemeier Hansson who really dug Ruby and thought it'd be perfect for his idea to create a streamlined framework for developing on the Web. I'd say he did pretty well for himself given how much people talk about Rails.</p>
<p>Here's why you should care: If you know how to use it well. People will pay you, very well. A little mercenary of me to flat out say...but as far as I've seen, it's true. Apparently's there's a high demand for skilled Ruby/Ruby on Rails develoeprs. So happy hunting you aspiring developer!!</p>
</section>

<!--Conclusion-->
<section>
  <p>Anyway, that was a very brief introduction to frameworks and Rails. If you want to learn more: Google it. Obviously. Or keep watching this blog as I learn more. One thing to look into, is PHP. I plan on learning more when I have the opportunity, but I see a lot of people arguing about whether it's better to use a framework, or create your own using PHP or other means.</p>
