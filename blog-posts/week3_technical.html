<h4>Why is JavaScript so popular in web development?</h4>
<p>Based on what I've seen...pure momentum. As far as I've been able to find out in my research, there aren't really any competing languages against it in it's space as a language for web app development. I mean, I've seen talk about some thing called VBScript, and I have no fucking clue what that even is.</p>
<p>The fact that I'm struggling to find any sort of alternative on Google speaks miles for the language's popularity. It's not a matter of which or anything like that. YOU USE JAVASCRIPT. PERIOD.</p>

<h4>What are the great things about JavaScript?</h4>
<p>Well, it's very simple and easy to learn as I've discovered this week. I'm not a pro and I'm barely into understanding how object-based programming works so I may have a better opinion later.</p>

<p>It loads very quickly on websites (at least if you have a decent computer and even if you don't in some cases). It's very versatile, and you can do a wide range of things using the language.</p>

<h4>What are its limitations?</h4>
<p>I don't have any personal experience with it's limitations, but from what I've read on the net, it's a pain making the code work consistently across different browsers because of it's nature as a client-side script. Different settings and browsers will apparently see different things. </p>


<p>I've done research. And frankly, at this level in my education as a programmer, none of it really means anything to me. I don't even see any point in thinking about it's limitations (at my level) because there aren't any alternatives to use anyway. I'm going to have to learn how to use JavaScript regardless of how I feel about it or whatever limitations it has.</p>

<p>Speaking more straightforwardly then i already tend to do...I'm too much of a noob to be speaking on this matter. I don't really voice opinions on things until I have reason to believe I understand what I would be talking about in the first place. </p>
