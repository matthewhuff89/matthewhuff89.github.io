<p>I just watched Shereef's video. I love that analogy about DBC being a "kitchen". Mostly because I spent half a year working in the kitchen at a Buffalo Wild Wings, and I learned the biggest lessons about teamwork and mindset I'd ever learned in my life. A life mind you, where I had just graduated from college, and I was an Eagle Scout. It's weird...you can learn big ass lessons just about anywhere if you can learn in the kitchen of a Buffalo Wild Wings during the University of Alabama's football season(in other words: Wing Hell). But I digress, I'm fucking excited about attending DBC. Really, really stoked. I've just completed my first week, and I've already learned so, so much about the internet, HTML, CSS, design, all sorts of things.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>I'll meet you halfway Shereef. I'm gonna come to the kitchen with yall. I'm gonna be energetic, and open to everything. And I love that ya'll are giving me the chance to be my true self. I'm gonna give you guys everything I got. I've been hungry, thirsty, and all sorts of weird ass adjectives for this sort of opportunity for my whole life, and it's here...</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>I'm just gonna go ahead and conclude this post, because it's late and i'm tired. I'm psyched as all hell for this program. The first week actually kicked my ass, and I LOVE THAT. Because for all those times my ass was kicked, came a moment where I figured out WHY I was getting my ass kicked, and that was such a GREAT feeling!! This week has really activated a part of my mind that I rarely get to use, and I've found myself completely committed to this program now. I've worked harder on this material than anything in the last 12 months. I know that I'm going to love the culture, the environment, the material, everything. I am so blessed to even have this opportunity that it just blows my mind.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>That's it. Till next time.</p>
