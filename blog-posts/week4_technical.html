<p>What's up everyone! Welcome back to the Technical Zone. (That's what I'm calling it now. Deal with it.)</p>

<p>Today, we're gonna talk about Hashes.</p>
<p>From Ruby's documentation, "A Hash is a dictionary-like collection of unique keys and their values. Also called associative arrays, they are similar to arrays, but where an Array uses integers as its index, a Hash allows you to use any object type."</p>


<p>What all those fancy words mean is that a Hash is a key(a word, or a string) that you give a definition/value to
(It can be a number, another string, whatever)</p>

<p>Here's an example:</p>
<p>awesome = {"Coding" => "Yes!", "Doodoo" => "No."}</p>
<p>So if you decided to access Coding inside of the Awesome hash, you would type out awesome["Coding"], "Coding" being the key, and it would output "Yes!" - Which is the value!</p>

<p>Another way to create a hash would be to type:</p>
<p>awesome = Hash.new<br>awesome["Coding"] = "Yes!"</p>
<p>And bam! You've got yourself a fresh Hash with a key/value pair in it!
</div>

<p>This is a short introduction, but you can do a lot with hashes once you start needing to manage a lot of data, and need an easy way to call on it.</p>
<p>Till next time</p>
