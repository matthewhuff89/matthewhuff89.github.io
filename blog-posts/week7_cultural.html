<!--Introduction to Topic-->
<section>
<p>Today, I'm being asked to explore my values. Hm. Yeah, I can do that.</p>
</section>

<!--First Paragraph-->
<section>
  <h4>Exploring My Values</h4>
  <p>When I think about the times in my life where I've just been the most satisfied. The values of Adventure, Enthusiasm, and Self-Mastery comes to mind. When I went to Brazil at the end of my undergraduate time, I learned more about myself and had more fun than I'd had the previous 4 years. EASILY. It was kind of trippy honestly. I'd always felt like something was missing in my life, and for about a month, I had that thing. It was freaking awesome.</p>
</section>

<!--Second Paragraph-->
<section>
  <h4>My Most Important Value</h4>
  <p>By a wide margin, I value Self-Mastery over just about everything. I suffered greatly due to my lack of self-mastery and discipline up to this point in my life, and I reached a point where I committed to master myself at all costs. No matter what I had to throw away or give up, I decided I would become the master of my mind and life.</p>
  <p>I never thought I was that bad a person or anything. I was an Eagle Scout, I knew I was intelligent, but I never felt like I was in control, or had any sort of choice in how things went.</p>
  <p>And eventually, after the incredible dissapointment that was my college experience, I realized that it was up to me to decide what kind of man I was going to be. Everything happening now is just the consequences of that paradigm shift.</p>
</section>

<!--Third Paragraph-->
<section>
  <p>As far as living up to my values is concerned. I always try to live up to my value of Self-Mastery. Everything else, I believe will come from that single idea. If I'm really master of my life, then I will find all the Enthusiasm, Adventure, Wealth, Wisdom, Etc. I could ever need.</p>
  <p>When I think about my primary values...I get frustrated, because I don't feel like I'm living up to them yet. I also get excited because I think about a world in which I have finally managed to embody those values, and I get energized to keep going.
</section>

<!--Conclusion-->
<section>
  <p>There really ain't much to be said. I value Self-Mastery above all things. I don't expect to be able to fulfill most other values unless I can live up to that one. That's why I meditate every day. That's why I've been slowly destroying my bad habits(As of last week, I completed a 90-day ban on weed and alcohol. Now, I've basically got no desire for either one.) and creating new good habits (Daily meditation, next up is good financial management habits)</p>
