<p>What's up ya'll. I've been asked to speak on a problem facing the tech world. I looked around a bit, but I didn't see nothing that particularly struck my fancy, except...for Technological Unemployment. I spend a lot of time on Reddit's Futurology subreddit...like, the last 2 years I've been lurking there. A big topic of discussion for a long time now, has been what are we going to do as a culture when all the work is being done by robots, machines, and programs, made by dudes like me. A good question if you ask me.</p>

<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-bots-are-taking-away-jobs-2014-3">Check out what Mr. Bill Gates thinks about this</a>

<p>This is basically a living god of the tech industry saying "Yeah, this shit is happening, ya'll need to be paying attention"
What's crazy to me is how, I don't know anybody who doesn't believe this is happening...and yet...I don't see or hear much from governments about dealing with this inevitability. Some big names are finally starting to speak up though, so...I dunno. I really don't.</p>

<p>
Think about it, we're on track to lose...what, 50% of jobs over the next 20 years? That's a fuckload of work that just plain no longer needs to be done by us weak, sleep/food requiring humans. What the fuck happens then? Are people just gonna have to suck it up and start robbing each other/everyone else blind? Or will the long-shot (well, maybe not long-shot) happen, and we start seeing some incredible wealth-distribution policies go into effect?
</p>

<p>
As far as I've seen, the only solution I can think of, is going to be basic income. (Basic income being a government-distributed check that covers all of a person's basic needs for the year. Well, that's the idea, if you want to know more, Google it.) I just can't think of any other way that people are going to be able to continue somewhat-fulfilling lives otherwise. And if it DOESN'T happen, we're gonna see some crazy Elysium/Mad Max type shit with people doing whatever it takes to get a meal. Just a huge freaking uprising bigger than anything anyone's ever seen all over the world.
</p>

<p>
  Still, to be honest, I don't think that's gonna happen. The government will cave, and hopefully start taxing companies properly, and use that income to feed/clothe the country.
</p>
<p>
  So...what happens after that? Will people start living for themselves and we see a cultural shift of epic proportions? I hope so.
</p>

<p>Till next time.</p>
