<!--Introduction to Topic-->
<section>
<p>Today I'm going to be talking about asking good questions and what the hell I mean by 'asking a good question'. I'm gonna take a look at some questions I found people ask on Stackoverflow and just take a look at why it is or isn't a well-asked question. Is well-asked a thing? I'm doing it, whatever.</p>
</section>

<!--First Paragraph-->
<section>
  <p>Basically, here's what I think makes a good question. Be SPECIFIC and give it the context related to what you are doing. That's it.</p>
</section>

<!--Second Paragraph-->
<section>
  <p>For example...</p>
  <p>Bad: How do I shot web?</p>
  <p>What does the asker even mean by that? What's with that terrible grammar? What are you shooting web at? Why do you need to shoot web?</p>
  <p>Good: I'm in a fight with a diabolical super-villain. I'm using this web-like substance, and I need to figure out how to launch it at him so that I can stick him to a wall and then beat the crap out of him. Any ideas?</p>
  <p>So much better! I know why, and what this fellow needs to do, and I could use a little more information, but this is a great start!</p>
</section>

<!--Third Paragraph-->
<section>
  <p></p>
</section>

<!--Conclusion-->
<section>
  <p>In conclusion, just be as specific as you humanly can about your problem and WHY it's a problem in the first place and you'll be fine.</p>
</section>

<!--Farewell!-->
<p>Till next time!</p>
