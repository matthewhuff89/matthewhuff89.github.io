<!--Introduction to Topic-->
<section>
<p>So, today I'm expected to discuss Stereotype Threat. A term I had never heard before today. Hm. Where do I start?</p>
</section>

<!--First Paragraph-->
<section>
  <p>Well, I guess i'll start by defining it, basically stereotype threat is another way of saying "being expected to act a certain way because of who you are". Everyone who is a human being deals with this. It comes from our psychology and the nature of influence. This is a topic I generally, don't put a lot into, because I know a lot of people who seem like they should fit into stereotypical molds, and then succeed, or simply defy expectations just because.</p>
</section>

<!--Second Paragraph-->
<section>
  <p>My dad grew up poor as hell in segregated Atlanta, GA, and ultimately became an influential businessman and investor here in my home state of Alabama. It would have been easy for him to end up being a criminal, or mediocre, but he didn't, despite the significant amount of stereotype threat in his environment. He wouldn't even consider such a thing, he's the type of dude who constantly tells me "some people are just sorry". So I never really played into getting upset about racism or being stereotyped. I generally hold myself responsible for my failures. </p>
</section>

<!--Third Paragraph-->
<section>
  <p> I kind of just don't even bother thinking about my stereotype or racism. I'm a black geek so I've certainly been judged on my appearance. I've heard "you're not really black" so many times that I'm shocked I didn't just fucking kill the next person to say it just to make a point. But frankly, it just ain't worth it. The best revenge is a life well lived, that's how I go about things. I refuse to let racism shape my world. It's there. It's been there. For thousands, and thousands, and thousands of years. Humans judge each other based on stupid ass distinctions as much as we breathe. We're fuckin awful sometimes. We're probably not going to stop until we're united against some existential threat like hostile aliens/robots/C'thulu/global warming/zombies.

<!--Conclusion-->
<section>
  <p>Well, I did my best to express how I felt about this stuff. And I don't think my best was very good. But this is just something I refuse to let influence me. I've had great friends from all races, I've met fucking assholes from all races. Matter of fact, my own race probably brought me more misery as a young kid than any other because I was different from what our own expectations are. I grew up hearing from my mom about being stereotyped by others, and then I realized on my own because of experience, "oh, EVERY race has it's share of fucking assholes."</p>
  <p>Ugh, I'm just gonna TLDR this. Here's how I feel about being stereotyped: "Fuck that guy. Fucking asshole.", Here's what I'll do when I think that's happening: "I'm gonna ignore that guy, and go find some righteous people to learn and grow with." If it happens to me in public? I'll call em the fuck out. I am NOT classy. I may be a geek, but I'm still a Southern black man. If someone actually manages to piss me off where I can't ignore them anymore, then I will let them know and we will handle it then and there.</p>
  <p>Fuck stereotypes.</p>
