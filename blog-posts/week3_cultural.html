<p>One of my driving quests in life is...hard to explain. After a particular set of experiences, I realized that I was going to become much more proactive and mastery/growth-focused than I had been my entire life.</p>

<p>Before that experience, I would certainly say that I was a "fixed mindset" type of dude. All my experiences and adults in my life heavily implied that people can't really change. That was all and well till I woke up one day (well, it more of a build up) and was horrified at what I had become and realized that I was going to have to change that mindset if I was going move forward and become someone I could call "a good man. a righteous dude."</p>

<p>Switching to a growth-mindset was probably the best thing that ever happened to me. If I had known that a man could really, truly change himself for the better with a fuckload of effort when I was younger, god damn I could have saved myself a lot of time. But shit, better late than never right?</p>


<p>Anyways, let me relate this back to DBC. I've been asked to consider what's been the greatest struggle for me so far. It's been properly managing my time. Easily. I get distracted, badly sometimes. The work hasn't been that bad frankly. I know with enough time, effort, and wisdom that I can overcome most blocks. My problem is just getting the momentum.Which i've done a LOT better with this week. The last 2 weeks, I really only did my DBC work maybe 3 days out of the 7. This week I've done SOMETHING every single day, and god DAMN do I feel better about it. I'm still a little behind, but I ain't worried. I'll handle this.</p>


<p>Distraction and momentum being problems isn't something I was unaware either. That's why I meditate twice a day in hour-long chunks. I'm training my mind to be concentrated and calm come hell or high fucking water. My goal in life is to achieve complete and total mastery over mind and body, and DBC is a means for me to accomplish that goal. I've always envied the way programmers could concentrate so hard for so long, and I've determined to take that ability for myself (while gaining a skill I can use to earn money and further develop my mind).</p>


<p>An interesting thing I learned about myself (thanks to DBC), is that I have what is apparently a completely and totally Random style of thinking. We were made to take a quiz to determine how we think and here are the results:</p>

<ul>
<li>Concrete Sequential: 16</li>
<li>Abstract Sequential: 8</li>
<li>Abstract Random: 44</li>
<li>Concrete Random: 48</li>
</ul>

<p>Apparently, I am completely fucking random. I can't say that this was a surprising result. I found the test to be very accurate to my self-image. When I read more about the Abstract and Concrete style, I had to laugh at how much they contradict each other. Though I can't really call it a contradiction as much as it is just a part of being a human. We ain't all just one thing all the time. What we are changes from second to second. Even if you don't have a growth-mindset, I assure you, you're changing whether you know it or not. They call this idea in Buddhism "transiency" or "non-permanence", one of the basic principles of life and reality.</p>

<p>Anyway, I've gone long enough, I've said all I feel like saying. Till next time.</p>
