<!--Introduction to Topic-->
<section>
<p>Today, I'm going to talk about conflict. To be honest, it's not something I honestly have a lot of experience with, at least as far as I can remember. So this is going to be pretty short.</p>
</section>

<!--First Paragraph-->
<section>
  <p>To be fair, I feel like the biggest emotional conflicts I have are with myself. No person, or individual outside of myself has ever done any real emotional harm to me that I couldn't get over or shrug off for the most part.</p>
  <p>I really just don't give a fuck, and I'm not intimidating enough or vulnerable-looking enough to have people bothering me.</p>
  <p>So in light of that, let me reiterate: As far as my emotions are concerned, I've always been my worst enemy. I've gotten angrier, sadder, etc. with myself than any other person. It's easy for me to shrug off what other people do to me because I just don't take that shit personally. Fuck it, I know they're going through shit themselves and I just wish em well. However, I have a hard time letting myself slide. That's just me, I'm working on it though :P</p>
</section>

<!--Second Paragraph-->
<section>
  <p>The most memorable emotional conflict I can think of, was between me, and my...hm, for lack of a better word, my dark side, or my Yang. Whatever you'd like to call it.</p>
  <p>I came to the end of my college career, and realized I hated what I became, and where I was heading at the rate i was going. So...I spent a lot of time getting pretty hammered. This was like, 3 months worth of time in my last year, so it's not like it was a long time or anything. But it was memorable.</p>
  <p>To answer DBC's question "Did it make things better or worse?", the answer is an emphatic "WORSE"</p>
  <p>I was having what I had always heard about: an identity crisis. I didn't know who I was, or what I was trying to be, and it drove me fucking crazy. It took a lot for me to forgive myself for not being better (unreasonable, I know, but again, I'm my biggest critic, easily)</p>
  <p>This particular conflict ended when one of my good friends basically called me out and told me to get my shit together. Which worked. If I hadn't gotten cussed out that night, I have no idea where I'd be right now.</p>
</section>

<!--Third Paragraph-->
<section>
  <p>I was so ashamed of my behavior that I quickly improved and got back to...well, not normal, but more balanced haha. That was when I started meditating and made my promise to master myself and become a better man. </p>
  <p>If I could do it all over...well, I'd have to go back way further in time to prevent that particular conflict. Like, all the way to middle school/high school. I would have found someone to mentor me on improving myself instead of just being a self pitying little bitch. Or at least I would have started learning martial arts, way, way earlier.</p>
  <p>You know? I ain't gonna bullshit myself. I don't think I could have prevented that conflict. It had to happen. And I'm glad it happened the way it did because I didn't end up hurting myself or anyone else.</p>
</section>

<!--Conclusion-->
<section>
  <p>Shit happens. Just develop your awareness, and try to feel empathy, put yourself in the other person's shoes. In my case, I'm learning to have more empathy for myself.</p>
  <p>Now, I'm gonna go listen to Kendrick Lamar's "i" on repeat.</p>

<p>Till next time!</p>
