<!--Introduction to Topic-->
<section>
<p>Today I'm here to talk about SQL Injection. The coldest shit I've heard of so far while learning about web development. I'm going to go ahead and link to this comic that DBC used to introduce me to this topic, because I think it's hilarious now that I know some SQL.</p>
<a href="http://xkcd.com/327/">This mom is too cold.</a>
<p>What happened in that comic: This asshole of a mother took advantage of her son's school's database code to delete their student records. She must have already hacked them to see how their SQL processed student name inputs to make that Injection work in the first place...but I digress. This is one brutal woman.</a>
</section>

<!--First Paragraph-->
<section>
  <p>What is SQL injection you ask?</p>
  <p>To keep it simple, SQL injection is what happens when a malicious user (i.e. a jerk, mom, or hacker) inserts SQL commands into an SQL statement using web pages' input fields (like username or password fields)</p>
  <p>In the case from XKCD comic, Robert's mom inserted a DROP TABLE command into the field where she was supposed to put her son's first name. She piggybacked the command on her son's name, along with some well-setup syntax that would fit in perfectly with how the school's website reads code.</p>
</section>

<!--Second Paragraph-->
<section>
  <p>Why is this such a problem?</p>
  <p>Well, because smart,evil dudes/ladies can take advantage of these opportunities to A. Alter the tables/fields/data in a database, B. Pull all the data for their own purposes, like passwords, credit card information, etc., C. Just dick around or make a point.</p>
  <p>Assuming the malicious party knows how the website's SQL code interprets user input, they can insert commands like "SELECT * FROM bank_info WHERE 1=1;", and get all of the information from that table since 1=1 always comes out to True for any field. Next thing you know, all the bank info you had on that website's table is up for grabs somewhere on the internet.</p>
</section>

<!--Third Paragraph-->
<section>
  <p>What can you do to combat this issue?</p>
  <p>Use SQL parameters. I'm not an expert on this topic, but I can break down how it works. SQL parameters are values that are added to an SQL query ONLY when it's time for the code to be executed. To quote from W3Schools' EXCELLENT tutorial on SQL Injection, "The SQL engine checks each parameter to ensure that it is correct for it's column and are treated literally, and not as part of the SQL to be executed".</p>
  <p>To define something as a parameter you would use an @ sign in the line for WHERE. So it would be like...</p>
  <p>txtWarriorName = getRequestString("WarriorName");</p>
  <p>txtSQL = "SELECT * FROM warriors WHERE WarriorName = @0";</p>
  <p>db.Execute(txtSQL,txtWarriorName);</p>
  <p>Does this make sense? You're sort of compartmentalizing your data inputs, and keeping them protected unti it's time to execute.</p>
</section>

<!--Conclusion-->
<section>
  <p>Hope you learned something about SQL and Injections today! I know I did. No way in HELL I'm gonna let some jerk get me like that mom in XKCD now that I know that this is something that can happen!</p>
