<p>What's up friend. So I understand you want to know more about relative, absolute, and fixed positioning right? I think I can help with that. Follow me</p>

<section class="mrfix">
  <p color="yellow">MR. FIX IS FIXED</p>
</section>

<p>
I'm gonna start off slow, cause I don't know where you're at, and I don't wanna lose you. Let's start off with what CSS is in the first place. CSS is Cascading Style Sheets. It's a type of file that creates cascading effects on the HTML it's linked to. It overlaps the HTML, like putting one page on top of another. Except the piece of paper you put on top of the bottom one (the HTML) is covered in fancy graphics, and colors, and moves stuff around on the bottom one.
</p>

<p>A major part of using these CSS files, is to change the positioning of the elements (objects, paragraphs, pictures, etc) on the HTML/webpage. You can do this by creating a stylesheet (let's call it for the moment stylesheet.css), and opening the file and changing the attribute, "position". So let's say you have a link, or sentence you want people to be able to see anywhere, you would change that "position: fixed"
</p>

<p>So now, i'm gonna show you some examples, I made a special stylesheet separate from the one I normally use for my blog posts, so this stuff can make more sense to you!</p>

<p>This was obnoxious of me, but you see Mr. Fix right? There's no way in hell you don't. If you don't see Mr. Fix then something is seriously wrong and you can't read.</p>
<p>You see how it moves with the scroll? And it's just...fixed there? That's what happens when you do what i did, and make a piece of CSS code like this.<br>
( .mrfix { position:fixed } )

<p>That's how you fix an element! Simple right?</p>

<p>Next, let me introduce you to the Relative.</p>

<section class="therelative">
  <p>I AM RELATIVE TO EVERYTHING. SUP?</p>
</section>

<section class="therelativeright">
  <p>CHECK ME OUT, IM RELATIVELY RIGHT</p>
</section>
<section class="therelativeleft">
  <p>WASSSSSSSSUP IM RELATIVELY LEFT</p>
</section>

<p>Ok, that's enough of that. Now for the explanation! See, those last 2, weren't in their original position. They moved 20px in a direction. Relatively Right's CSS was {left:20px} and Relatively Left's was {left:-20px}. They moved like that because of their positions! Now here's a normal example to bring it home.
<section class="normal">
  <p>Hey, I'm a normal p element.</p>
</section>
<p>I actually set that normal to be "left: 60px" But it didnt move. Because 1. It was just a regular static element, and 2. It didn't have anything to move relative to, so that left attribute did absolutely nothing. Speaking of absolute...</p>

<section id="absolute1">
  <p>I AM ABSOLUTE. I GO WHERE I PLEASE!!!</p>
</section>

<p>{position: absolute} means Absolute can go wherever it wants on the page, divs, positions, everything be DAMNED. Seriously, you're like, all up in my sentence bro. (But it's my fault for not realizing that I'm actually in it's territory!). It can go in front of a picture, a paragraph, it can go to the far left, right, top, or bottom of the page. You set the dimensions, and it goes there. You don't have to move nothing, it just goes there.</p>

<section id="absolute2">
  <p>BOW BEFORE MY ABSOLUTE POWER!!</p>
</section>

<p>You see that Orange absolute? If it's positioning were normal/static, it wouldn't be all over my sentence. But it is, because it's absolute, and that's where it was initially seated. If it were static, it'd be in a nice, neat position below that sentence...but it's not. It's absolute.</p>

<p>Ok bro, I hope you get it, because i'm tired, and these absolutes are all up in my shit.</p>

<p>Till next time...</p>
