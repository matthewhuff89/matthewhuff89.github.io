<!--Intro to Pairing-->
<section>
<p>What's up everyone! I'm back, and today i'd like to talk about this thing we do in the DBC program called Pair Programming. It's pretty dope.</p>

<p>To start with, pairing is what happens when two boots connect and decide to work on one of the week's challenges together. They set a time and day, and meet up (over the net) to crush it. Generally, it's set up so that one person "drives"(they type out the code) and another person "navigates", and keeps their eye on the big picture and makes a plan to solve the challenge. Ideally the pair will switch roles over the course of the challenge so that both sides get a full experience. Just as often however, the pair just agrees to work together and talk out the challenge and work it out together at the same time. Whatever floats the boat.</p>

<!--Pairing: What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges? Was something particularly fun or rewarding? Was something frustrating and difficult for you?-->
<section>
  <p>
I don't do it all the time, but I really enjoy it when I do. My reason for not wanting to pair too much is that, I feel like in SOME cases (not all!) I'll absorb more if I have to work it out myself. Though I suppose that's the point of Solo Challenges, so I might as well just get over that hah.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's really rewarding when after an hour or 2, together, the pair finally figures out how to solve the challenge, and there's this palpable relief and joy that we have overcome yet another nefarious DBC challenge. I love that feeling.
    </p>
<p>
  It's really frustrating for me sometimes too, when one person is just far more competent and comfortable with the material, and I don't feel like I'm really benefitting the group. In those cases I still learn a bunch, and I've never had a pair who wasn't patient with explaining concepts I didn't get. It's really just a matter of me being proud and wanting to feel like I helped.
</p>
<p>
After my most recent pairing session though, I've learned to just go with the flow, if someone figures out the best way to solve a problem, then that's cool, support them and help out!
  </p>
  <p>
    Yeah...I'm going to make an effort to pair more.

<!--Feedback: How did you feel when you read your feedback? Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning? Based on the feedback you've received, what are you doing to do to improve next time you pair? How was it to write feedback? What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?-->
<section>
  <p>
    In the Bootcamp, we also get and give feedback about our pairing sessions. I actually enjoy it, I'm always open to feedback on how I could do things better. I've found it pretty helpful for me figuring out the best way to learn and grow.
  </p>
  <p>
    I think the best piece of feedback I got told me that I need to be willing to admit when I don't know something and feel comfortable with looking it up or asking for help. I can already tell that one piece of feedback will have a big effect on how I do things from now on.
  </p>
  <p>
    I like writing feedback too. Only problem is I rarely find anything to constructively criticize. I can criticize myself endlessly, but when it comes to others....ah who am I kidding, I can do it, I just don't feel comfortable doing so. I try anyway though when I can think of something worth pointing out.
  </p>

<!--Overall, what do you think of using pairing and feedback to guide your learning?-->
<section>
  <p>
    Overally, I think pairing and feedback are great systems, that I could have used a lot more in high school and college. Didn't feel like I got a lot of good feedback in school besides grades, nothing that was particularly actionable besides 'study more'. I'm glad I've gotten to have this experience.

<!--Conclusion, final thoughts-->
<section>
  <p>
What else is there for me to say? Pairing is pretty dope. I've gotten to talk with some really cool people through doing so and I hope I get to continue!
  </p>
<p>Till next time...</p>
