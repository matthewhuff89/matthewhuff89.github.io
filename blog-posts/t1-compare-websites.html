<p>Hm. I've been asked by DBC to describe my favorite websites and explain why I like them. Two of them, are quite frankly, very simple websites. They're not super fancy, or have a lot of flash. But they serve a purpose that fulfills my needs effectively. My first 2 choices would be <a href="www.kotaku.com">www.kotaku.com</a> and <a href="www.reddit.com">www.reddit.com</a>. Kotaku fills my need for news on all things geeky as hell, and Reddit fills my need for a steady stream of information and conversation on my favorite topics that don't really see diverse discussion anywhere else, like meditation, futurism, and some other things I'm not going to get into here ;)  The third site is <a href="www.wikipedia.com">www.wikipedia.com</a> which I have always, always loved. As a very whimsical, curious person, Wikipedia has led me to some great topics and knowledge that would have been a pain to find on my own</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Anyway, I'm going to get a little deeper into my reasons for liking each one. I'm going to start with Kotaku. Speaking frankly, it's one of the geekiest places I've found on the internet. All the dorkiness and weirdness of 4chan without all of the...horror...of 4chan. There's generally an article, or video on the website at any time of the day that catches my eye. Either a review of some cool anime out. Or a preview of a new game. Or just some goofy gamer humor. I rarely go to the site and leave unsatisfied. The design is simple, it's just a stream of recent posts on the right, and recommended/popular posts on the left. Sometimes I end up at interesting places because of the recommendations and I like that feeling. It's just a damn good games/anime/etc. blog. It gives me what I want, with very little effort required on my part.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Next, I gotta give it up to reddit. I honestly never even used the site until about a year ago, and I almost never, ever post anything. But i've found some amazing things on that site related to my interests that I would never have come across on my own. Any sort of niche hobby or interest that you have, probably has a subreddit. That's huge for me. I live in a medium sized city in Alabama, and it's often difficult for me to find people practicing or talking about things that I'm deeply interested in. Reddit (partially) filled that hole for me, because now, I can find people who share my interests with ease, and can send me deeper than I would have gotten on my own. It's incredibly easy to just put out a search and find a subreddit talking about whatever you're looking for, subscribe to it, and bam, you're in. It's not a sharp looking site to me, but the content is just rock fucking solid all the god damn time. As I think about what I'm saying here I'm realizing I am very much a "function" before "form" type of dude.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Finally, Wikipedia. I love that damn site. I find it to be a great introduction to any new concept or topic I hear about, and want to just get a general idea what it's about. I started getting into Buddhism years ago, and got a lot of good info and some basic terminology there. Then I started clicking the Related items, and found myself going deeper down the rabbit-hole of spirituality and contemplative practice. It would take me a while to describe that particular journey, but Wikipedia is partially responsible for it. It's easy for me to search for whatever I'm interested in, and it always suggests Related Content that always helps fill in gaps or further fuel my curiousity. There's not a whole lot of distracting stuff, it's simple, and it gives me what I need. That's all I ask for. When I look for something, be somewhere I know I can go get it, and you will win my loyalty. That does sound vague and general, but I don't know how else to express it.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Yeah, that's how I feel. Till next time.</p>
