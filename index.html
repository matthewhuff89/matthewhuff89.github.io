            What's up? I'm Matt. I'm a software engineer living in Brooklyn, NY. I was born an raised in Birmingham, AL and went to the University of Alabama. I like build projects, dance, exercise, meditate, and play video games in my free time.
          </p>
          <p>
            I like to push myself constantly to get out of my comfort zone, and try out new things or learn skills that scare me. So if I seem a bit weird, especially in how i choose my projects, now you know :)

          <p>I'm working through a book called <a href="https://www.buildyourownlisp.com">Build Your Own Lisp</a> to fulfill a long-standing curiosity i've had about how languages are born. I'm also really curious about low-level languages like C, which I feel like are the secret language running a lot of our daily lives. I figured this project would be great for 1. Getting me in the habit of building side projects, 2. Teaching more about functional programming languages, 3. Actually building programming languages, and 4. Learning how to build with C.</p>
