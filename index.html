          <h1>Purpose</h1>
          <p>Hey, I'm Matt.</p>
          <p>I'm a very purpose, and principle-minded person.</p>
          <p>After my experiences at college and beyond, I realized that for me to live a truly dope, happy, present life, I needed to be clear with my intentions.</p>
          <p>A powerful, singular purpose can bestow great power and motivate one to act in ways they previously thought they were incapable of.</p>
          <p>It can be a guiding light in the darkest of times.</p>
          <p>After spending months in meditation and reflection after a private mental breakdown...I created my own purpose. My own way of life.</p>
          <p>My purpose in life, is to master my mind, body, and spirit, and help others do the same with technology and imagination.</p>
          <p>That's it. Everything I do is to stay true to that idea.</p>
          <p>Of course, it's not some immutable, unchanging thing, but...for the moment, this feels right, y'know?</p>
          <p>What's your purpose? How do you choose to live your life?</p>
