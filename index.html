            What's up? I'm Matt. I'm a software engineer living in Brooklyn, NY. I was born an raised in Birmingham, AL and went to the University of Alabama. I like to code, dance, exercise, meditate, and play video games in my free time.

          <p>
            I like to push myself constantly to get out of my comfort zone, and try out new things or learn skills that scare me. This philosophy has led me to many interesting places, such as learning more about systems programming, or learning how to dance...what can I say, I follow my curiosity wherever it leads me!

          <p>
            I'm working through a book called <a href="https://www.buildyourownlisp.com">Build Your Own Lisp</a> to fulfill a long-standing curiosity i've had about how languages are born. I'm also really curious about low-level languages like C, which I feel like are the secret language running a lot of our daily lives. I figured this project would be great for getting me in the habit of building side projects, learning more about functional programming languages, building programming languages, and working with C. It's been a blast, i've also added my own touches such as more descriptive variable names, separating out logic into separate libraries, and implemented some types on my own!
